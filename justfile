# Per-repo task manifest. Run `just` (or `just --list`) to see every verb.
#
# Recipes take trailing arguments directly: `just <verb> a b`, where the
# retired form was `ward exec <verb> -- a b`.
#
# One line of comment per recipe on purpose: just reads only the LAST comment
# line above a recipe, so a wrapped description silently truncates to its tail.
#
# `ward exec` is retired. `.ward/ward.yaml` survives carrying catalog metadata
# only, because the catalog hooks upstream in agentic-os pin that exact path.
